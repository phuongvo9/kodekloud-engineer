# Task details:

# Production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks.\
    # One of them is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. They need to create a bash script named media_backup.sh which should accomplish below given tasks. (Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 3)

# a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_media.zip of /var/www/html/media directory.

# b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 3. This is a temporary storage as backups from this location will be clean on weekly basis so we also need to save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.

# c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server in /backup/ location.

# d. Please make sure script wonâ€™t ask for password while coping the archive file also respective server user (for example tony in case of App Server 1) must be able to run it.
